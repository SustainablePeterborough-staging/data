Footnotes:
1,"Historical comparison of geographic areas    The boundaries and names of census geographies can change from one census to the next. In order to facilitate data comparisons between censuses, previous census data have been adjusted to reflect as closely as possible the 2021 boundaries of these areas. The methodology used for this adjustment involved spatially linking blocks of previous censuses (concordance to the 1996 Census used the 1996 enumeration areas to the 2021 boundaries). A previous census block was linked to the 2021 area within which its representative point fell. A limited number of interactive linkages were completed to further enhance the adjustment in certain areas. For some census geographies, it was not possible to reflect the 2021 boundaries. The 2021 boundaries may not be reflected as there was no previous census block to assign to the 2021 area. As well previous census data for some 2021 areas may not be available due to the fact that the concordance did not produce an accurate representation of the 2021 area."
2,"Gender  Gender refers to an individual's personal and social identity as a man, woman or non-binary person (a person who is not exclusively a man or a woman).   Gender includes the following concepts:   gender identity, which refers to the gender that a person feels internally and individually;   gender expression, which refers to the way a person presents their gender, regardless of their gender identity, through body language, aesthetic choices or accessories (e.g., clothes, hairstyle and makeup), which may have traditionally been associated with a specific gender.  A person's gender may differ from their sex at birth, and from what is indicated on their current identification or legal documents such as their birth certificate, passport or driver's licence. A person's gender may change over time.   Some people may not identify with a specific gender. Sex    'Sex' refers to whether the person is male or female."
3,"Given that the non-binary population is small, data aggregation to a two-category gender variable is sometimes necessary to protect the confidentiality of responses provided. In these cases, individuals in the category “non-binary persons” are distributed into the other two gender categories and are denoted by the “+” symbol.  The sex variable in census years prior to 2021 and the two-category gender variable in the 2021 Census are included together. Although sex and gender refer to two different concepts, the introduction of gender is not expected to have a significant impact on data analysis and historical comparability, given the small size of the transgender and non-binary populations. For additional information on changes of concepts over time, please consult the Age, Sex at Birth and Gender Reference Guide."
4,"Age    'Age' refers to the age of a person (or subject) of interest at last birthday (or relative to a specified, well-defined reference date)."
5,"Low-income status  Low-income status refers to the income situation of the statistical unit in relation to a specific low-income line in a reference year. Statistical units with income that is below the low-income line are considered to be in low income.  For the 2021 Census, the reference period for low-income data is the calendar year 2020."
6,"For more information, refer to the Census Dictionary: Economic family; Economic family structure."
7,"The Market Basket Measure (MBM) refers to Canada's official measure of poverty based on the cost of a specific basket of goods and services representing a modest, basic standard of living developed by Employment and Social Development Canada (ESDC). The MBM thresholds represent the costs of specified qualities and quantities of food, clothing, shelter, transportation and other necessities for a reference family of two adults and two children. The square root of economic family size is the equivalence scale used to adjust the MBM thresholds for other family sizes. This adjustment for different family sizes reflects the fact that an economic family's needs increase, but at a decreasing rate, as the number of members increases.  The MBM basket (2018-base) is priced for 53 different geographic areas - 19 specific communities and 34 population centre size and province combinations. The MBM recognises the potential differences in the cost of the basket between similar-sized communities in different provinces and between different geographical regions within provinces. These thresholds are presented in Table 2.2 Market Basket Measure (MBM) thresholds for economic families and persons not in economic families, 2020, Dictionary, Census of Population, 2021.  The income measure used to compare against the MBM thresholds is the disposable income for the MBM. When the disposable income for the MBM of an economic family or a person not in economic family falls below the threshold applicable to the family or the person, the person or every member in the case of an economic family is considered to be in poverty according to MBM. Since the MBM threshold and disposable income are unique within each economic family, low-income status based on MBM can also be reported for economic families.  For the 2021 Census, the reference period for low-income data is the calendar year 2020."
8,"The 2018-base MBM low-income concept is not applied in the territories and on reserve."
9,"Poverty rate - The proportion or percentage of units whose income falls below a specified poverty line."
10,"Poverty gap ratio - The poverty gap measures by how many dollars an income falls below a poverty line. The poverty gap ratio expresses the poverty gap as a proportion of the applicable poverty line."
11,"Prior to the 2021 Census, this category refers to males. Starting in 2021, this category includes men (and/or boys), as well as some non-binary persons."
12,"Prior to the 2021 Census, this category refers to females. Starting in 2021, this category includes women (and/or girls), as well as some non-binary persons."
